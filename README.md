# 🧮 Age Calculator

This is a simple website that tells you your age in years, months, and days. You just enter your date of birth, and it will do the rest!

## 🌐 What I Used

* **HTML** – for the structure of the page
* **CSS** – to make it look nice
* **JavaScript** – to do the age calculation

## 🔍 How It Works

1. You pick your birthday.
2. Click the button.
3. It shows how old you are in years, months, and days.

## 📁 Files

* `agecalculator.html` – the main page
* `agecalculator.css` – the design
* `age calculator.js` – the code that calculates age

## ▶️ Try It

You can open the `agecalculator.html` file in your browser to try it.
